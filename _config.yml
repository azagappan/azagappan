# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

 Welcome to the world of Azagppan.  This is a personal site getting build to document my learning. I dont think you will find  anything interesting, as it will be more of 
 personal and boring stuff here.  Boring because,  I try to get in a little deeper than the  top grass grazing, which will be  of no interest for people who dont have time to read...  
 joking.. 
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://azagappan.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
