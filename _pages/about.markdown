Welcome to Azagu's world.    
<br> It is my attempt to articulate my learnings online.

Sir Isaac Newton  once said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.”.  I am what I am today is because of what I learnt from the gaints and experts.   The content here is my attempt to articulate my understanding on the subject that I have learnt, exprienced or learning. I will try to refer to the sources of information where possible. If you feel that I have voilated any of Copyright of yours, please write to me at azagappan at gmail.com and I shall have it removed or correct it.
